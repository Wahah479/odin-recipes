# odin-recipes

This is a project to create aa homepage that has links to three different recipes. Those pages include an image, description, ingredients, and steps for said recipe.

index.html contains an unordered list of the three links made with relative links to the other pages.

Each of the recipe pages have an image that it gets from the images folder in the parent directory.

It also makes use of headers to separate the page into clear section with the name of the food as the main header and "Description", "Ingredients", and "Steps" as sub-headers.

The Description header is followed by a <p> tag that contains a description of the item.

The Ingredients header is followed by an unordered list of what you need.

The Steps header is followed by an ordered list of what you need to do to make the item.
